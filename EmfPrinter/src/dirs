# VERY IMPORTANT: since Microsoft changed the DDK into the WDK
#                 I've been unable to produce a working .EXE
#                 installer using the "build" utility used to
#                 compile and link the driver.
#                 Thus this 'dirs' file does not contain the
#                 'installer' folder; the installer should be
#                 built using the makefile.vc in build/makefiles
#                 from the MSVC++'s DOS shell.
