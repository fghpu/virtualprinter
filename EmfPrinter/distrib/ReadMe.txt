 =============

 EmfPrinter has been uploaded to various software-listing websites
 to make it easier for the endusers to find it
 (it's incredible how many paying programs about EMF printing are
  available out there - but this is the only free alternative!).

 In order to submit EmfPrinter to such websites I've created a
 PAD file (pad.xml) which is composed from sourceforgenet.cml and
 emfprinter.pml. 
 For more info about this format see http://www.asp-shareware.org/pad/

 Place where EmfPrinter PAD file is kept:

   http://emfprinter.sourceforge.net/pad.xml

 Note that the various freeware website networks should be able to
 automatically retrieve updated versions of the PAD file from that
 location. So be careful to keep that URL valid and up2date!


 Websites where I sent EmfPrinter PAD:

  http://www.download.com     (CNET network which is tied to many other sites)
